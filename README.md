# Multi-Omic Data in Cervical Cancer Studies using Machine Learning

This repository contains code and resources related to the research topic "Multi-Omic Data in Cervical Cancer Studies using Machine Learning." The aim of this research is to help the medical society identify cervical cancer subtypes using multi-omics data of the patients.

## Objective

The main objectives of our research are as follows:

1. To study the factors that could influence the performance of each machine learning method and create an accurate machine learning model for predicting the subgroups of cervical cancer patients.
2. To study the influence of different features on predicting the subgroups of cervical cancer.
3. To study the differences between omic data and build a more accurate machine learning model by taking advantage of using multi-omic data instead of single-omic data.

## Data Source

We utilize the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data for our research. The following omics data types are used:

- miRNA Genome Data
- Gene Expression Profiling Data
- DNA Methylation Data

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the necessary data files. Please ensure the data files are appropriately placed in this directory before running the code.
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks showcasing the implementation of machine learning models and analysis of the multi-omic data.
- `src/`: This directory contains the source code files for preprocessing the data, training machine learning models, and evaluating their performance.
- `results/`: This directory will contain the results and outputs generated by the code.
